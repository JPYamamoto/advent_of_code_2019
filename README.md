# TypeScript Advent of Code

This is the repo containing my TypeScript code to solve the [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) 2019 challenges.

I decided to use TypeScript for this year's riddles in order to improve my skills on static-typed languages and focusing on the algorithms rather than the details of the language.

Not all my solutions have been optimal, but I've decided to leave them just as they were at the moment I solved each challenge. That is, partly because I don't have the time to go back and revisit each snippet, and also because I want to have an archive of my solutions for each year's AoC as evidence of my coding skills progress.

## How to use this repo?

1. Clone the repo.
2. Make sure you have node and npm installed.
3. Run `npm install` on the root directory.
4. Run `npm start` on the root directory to display the solutions.


## What is the Advent of Code?

The [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) is an annual event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

It is 25 days of December with two challenges per day, to be solved with code.

You choose the language and the tools you use to complete the tasks!

It is an excellent idea for everyone interested in improving their skills through fun short problems to solve with code.

## What is TypeScript?

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript. That is, you get the best of JavaScript, while taking advantage of all of the power that types checking can provide.

## Thank you
- [Eric Wastl]() for creating the challenges for this event every year.
